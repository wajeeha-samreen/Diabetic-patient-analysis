3.pre-processing the data for meaningful Analysis .

4.visualizing the data to uncover hidden patterns

5.Conducting features analysis to understand the influencing factors.

6.Building and evaluating predictive models.

Key Insights: Through rigorous data analysis, we understand the critical factors influencing the risk of diabetes:

1.Pregnancies:A higher number of pregnancies correlates with an elevated diabetes risk.

2 Blood Pressure: An increased in blood pressure,BMI and skin thickness is correlated with an increased likelihood of developing diabetes.

3.Glucose: Rising levels of glucose and insulin are linkedto an increased risk of diabetes

Insuline: Higher insuline levelswere found to direct impact ondiabetes risk with elevated levels increasing susceptiblity.
5.out of 768 patients, 268 patients have been diagnosed with diabetes
